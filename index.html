    <p>
      Subhas Chandra Bose, affectionately known as Netaji, was one of India's
      most revered freedom fighters. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack,
      Odisha, he was a leader whose relentless pursuit of India's independence
      left an indelible mark on the nation's history. Bose's courage, vision,
      and determination to free India from colonial rule inspired millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charismatic and dynamic leader, Bose initially worked within the Indian
      National Congress, rising to become its president in 1938 and 1939.
      However, his radical approach to achieving independence, which included
      his belief in armed struggle against the British, eventually led to
      differences with Mahatma Gandhi and other Congress leaders. This
      divergence of ideology prompted him to form the Forward Bloc and later,
      during World War II, the Indian National Army (INA) with the slogan "Give
      me blood, and I will give you freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bose sought international support for India's cause, allying with Axis
      powers such as Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, believing that their
      success would lead to India's liberation. He established the Azad Hind
      Government, a provisional Indian government in exile, which played a
      crucial role in galvanizing support for the INA's campaigns in Southeast
      Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy is a testament to his indomitable spirit and
      unyielding patriotism. His mysterious death in a plane crash in 1945
      remains a topic of speculation and intrigue, adding to the legend of
      Netaji. To this day, Bose is remembered as a symbol of resistance,
      bravery, and the undying quest for India's freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contemporary India, Netaji's legacy is honored through numerous
      institutions, memorials, and public spaces bearing his name. His life and
      struggle continue to inspire not only Indians but freedom fighters and
      leaders worldwide who seek to challenge oppression and fight for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Netaji's philosophy of "It is blood alone that can avenge the blood that
      the enemy has spilled" reflects his unwavering commitment to the cause of
      independence. His willingness to sacrifice everything, including his life,
      for the freedom of his people has immortalized him as a hero not just in
      India but across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subhas Chandra Bose's vision of a free and prosperous India, where every
      citizen could live with dignity and equality, remains a guiding light for
      the nation. His legacy endures in the hearts of millions, a constant
      reminder of the power of determination, courage, and the will to fight for
      what is right.
